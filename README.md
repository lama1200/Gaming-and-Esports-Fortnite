## Project Overview

This project explores the impact of the popular video game Fortnite on different aspects of human behavior, especially among adolescents and young adults. The study focuses on its effects on mental health, social life, and financial habits through user survey analysis and literature review.

## Key Findings

- A large percentage admitted to being influenced socially and mentally by gaming.
- Some participants gained friendships and skills through games, while others noted negative impacts like distraction and reduced self-control.
- **Esports** is seen as a serious field by many, and **Fortnite** is believed to have contributed significantly to its growth.

## Ethical Concerns

- Issues such as cyberbullying, fraud, and gaming addiction were highlighted.
- Loot boxes and virtual purchases pose financial risks, especially to younger players who are more susceptible to impulsive behavior.

## Conclusion

This research emphasizes the need for awareness and better gaming boundaries, especially among youth.
